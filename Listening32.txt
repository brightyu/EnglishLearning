A: "Hello?"
B: "Hey Tina. What are you doing?"
A: "I was just watching TV. What's going on with you?"
B: "I just watched a movie and I'm scared."
A: "What did you watch?"
B: "I saw the Sixth Sense. I didn't know it was going to be so scary."
A: "I remember that. It was a great movie. But it was definitely scary."
B: "If you're not busy, do you want to come over? I'm afraid to be alone."
A: "Sure. I can come over. What should we do?"
B: "How about if we watch a comedy. I need something to get my mind off the frightening images I have from the Sixth Sense."
A: "Ok. I'll get ready and leave. I'll see you in about 20 minutes."
B: "Hurry, ok. It's dark out."
A: "Don't worry, nothings going to happen. I'll be there real soon."
B: "Ok. See you soon."
