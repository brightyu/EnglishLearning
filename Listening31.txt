A: "Hey Mike. What are you doing?"
B: "Nothing much. What are you up to?"
A: "I was just concerned about Sam. He hasn't been himself lately."
B: "He took the civil service exam and failed."
A: "That sucks. He must feel depressed."
B: "Yeah. He's been sitting in his room everyday for the last 4 days."
A: "Why don't we take him out? We can try to take his mind off of it. In the least show him that we're there for him."
B: "That's a great idea. Why don't you call him. I already talked to him a couple of times and it might be good for him to hear from somebody else."
A: "Ok. I'll call you back after I'm done."
B: "Sounds good."
