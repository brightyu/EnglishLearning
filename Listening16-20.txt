A: "I haven't seen your father in like 5 years. How is he doing?"
B: "He's not doing too well."
A: "Why? What's wrong?"
B: "About a year ago, he started feeling weak all the time."
A: "Is it due to old age or is he sick."
B: "Maybe a little of both. The doctor's can't point out anything specifically. I think it is because he didn't take care of himself during his youth."
A: "That makes sense. It's important to take care of your health early in life."
B: "That's what my father tells me almost everyday."
A: "Well, I hope he starts feeling better. Say hi to him for me."
B: "Thanks. I'll let him know."

A: "Hey Sarah. Why are you limping?"
B: "Oh. Hi Matt. I went snowboarding yesterday and my whole body aches."
A: "Was it your first time?"
B: "Yeah. And I never want to go again."
A: "I remember the first time I went. My back was sore, I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt, and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast."
B: "That's exactly how I feel now."
A: "It's only like that the first couple of times."
B: "Ha. There won't be a next time."
A: "You gotta give it a chance. It's fun after awhile."
B: "I'll think about it after I start feeling better. Right now, I don't even want to hear the word snowboarding."

A: "Hey Jane. How are you doing these days?"
B: "Hi Martha. Everything is perfect."
A: "Are you enjoying married life?"
B: "It couldn't be better. My husband is so supportive with my work and he helps around the house so much."
A: "You're so lucky. I hope to get married to a guy like that."
B: "I'm so happy. Even though we are both working, we get to spend a lot of time with each other in the evening and on the weekends."
A: "Do you guys do anything special?"
B: "In the evening, we just sit and talk over dinner. But on the weekend, we try to go out to the beach or hit a nice restaurant, or go to a nice cafe."
A: "Sound like everything is great."

A: "Hey Stacy. What's going on?"
B: "I'm pretty tired these days."
A: "Why? You're not working so don't you have a lot of time on your hands?"
B: "I have so much house work to do. I have to take care of the kids, cook, clean, laundry, and the cycle never ends."
A: "How about your husband. Does he help much?"
B: "Not at all. He comes home and complains about his hard day at work. He expects me to do everything. He even wants me to feed him sometimes. Can you believe that?"
A: "That sucks."
B: "If he wasn't so lazy, I think I wouldn't have any complaints. He mows the lawn, but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it?"
A: "That's crossing the line."
B: "Oh well. I'll have to live with it. What else can I do?"

A: "Welcome. Can I help you with anything?"
B: "Hi. I'm shopping for my boyfriend's birthday. Do you have any suggestions?"
A: "Let's see. How about a nice shirt and tie? You can't go wrong there."
B: "Well. He doesn't wear ties that often."
A: "We have some nice pants. You can also get him a belt with it."
B: "That sounds good. Which one do you recommend?"
A: "These slacks are very popular. He can wear them to dress up a little or on a normal casual day."
B: "I like them. Do you have matching belts?"
A: "Yes. Right over here."
B: "How much are they?"
A: "The pants are on sale for $40, and the belt is $25."
B: "What is your return policy just in case he doesn't like them?"
A: "Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you."
B: "That sounds great. I'll take them."
